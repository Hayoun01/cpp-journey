# C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my C++ learning journey! This repository might seem a bit chaotic, but it's my personal playground where I document my progress and share my experiences. I hope you find something valuable and enjoyable as you explore.

## Explore, Modify, and Test

Feel free to dive into the code, make modifications, and experiment with different concepts. Learning is often messy, and this repository reflects that. Don't hesitate to make mistakes; that's part of the journey!

#### Compilation Guide

If you want to compile any C++ file, follow these simple steps:

```shell 
g++ filename.cpp -o output_file
./output_file
```
This will compile your C++ code and execute the output file. Use this process to test and run the various programs within this repository.

## Contribution Guidelines

If you have insights, suggestions, or corrections to offer, please feel free to contribute. Learning is a collaborative process, and your input can help enhance the quality of this repository.

Happy coding and enjoy the learning experience!
